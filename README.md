# Yog-Pose
LY MAJOR PROJECT

It can be difficult for beginners to perform yoga poses accurately without the
assistance of a certified instructor, especially when utilizing online platforms.
However, the growing popularity of online fitness programs has enabled individuals
to practice yoga at any location, making it more accessible. YouTube, one of the most
well-known video-sharing platforms, offers numerous yoga-related videos for people
to practice. By watching these videos, individuals attempt to perform yoga on their
own and persist until they achieve the correct pose as shown in the video without
undergoing any guidance. This can result in individuals incorrectly attempting yoga
poses, potentially causing physical harm. Therefore, there is a need for a system that
can detect and correct yoga postures in real time, in order to assist these individuals
by providing proper feedback.

AIM AND OBJECTIVE:
Our aim is to propose a yoga posture correction system that can accurately correct a
userâ€™s yoga pose in real time and alongside it, try to overcome the drawback of the
current systems, which is the limited number of yoga pose corrections.
The objective of this project is to assist people practicing yoga on their own by
providing them with the appropriate feedback needed while performing yoga so as to
prevent any kind of injury
